\section{Commands}
	A word following backslash is a \LaTeX{} command. There are 7 different commands in `day02.tex'. But, we will discuss the last three commands only.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[\textbackslash documentclass] Specifies the document class - article, letter, book, \dots. \LaTeX{} prepares a minimal document layout depending on the document class. This includes page margins and page numbering.
		\item[usepackage] This command allows us to use additional commands. There are hundreds of package available for different purposes. This includes packages for drawing images.
		\item[\textbackslash begin] This command is used to indicate the begin of an environment. In `day02.tex', document environment is used.
		\item[\textbackslash end] This command is used to indicate the end of an environment. 
		\item[\textbackslash section] This is the first level heading in an article document. The sections are numbered automatically in arabic numerals.
		\item[\textbackslash subsection] This is the second level heading in an article document. The subsections are also numbered. And the numbering of subsections will also indicate the number of its parent section.
		\item[\textbackslash subsection*] This a starred variant of subsection command.
	\end{enumerate}
